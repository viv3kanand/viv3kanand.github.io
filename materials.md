### Bios

**Short joint bio for Sonia and Eric**

In 2010, Sonia Vallabh watched her 52 year old mother die of a rapid, mysterious, undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease. One year later, Sonia learned that her mother's disease had been genetic, and that she herself had inherited the causal mutation, making it very likely she would suffer the same fate in 20 years' time. There was no prevention, treatment, or cure available. Despite having no prior training in biology, Sonia and her husband Eric Minikel set out to re-train themselves as scientists and devote their lives to searching for a treatment or cure for her disease. They quit their jobs in consulting, started a scientific blog, began taking night classes and attending conferences, found new jobs in research labs, and eventually enrolled as PhD students in biology at Harvard Medical School. They are now based in Stuart Schreiber's laboratory at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and have launched a new therapeutic initiative to discover drugs for her disease.

**Longer bio for Sonia**

In 2010, I watched my 52-year-old mother die of a rapid, mysterious, undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease. One year later, I learned that her mother's disease had been a genetic prion disease -- and that I was at fifty-fifty risk of having inherited the causal mutation. These diseases are universally fatal, and there is no prevention, treatment, or cure. I decided right away to pursue predictive testing, and this is how I learned that I had, indeed, inherited the PRNP D178N-cis129M variant, making it all but certain that I would suffer my motherâ€™s fate in 20 years' time. 

At the time I was a recent graduate of Harvard Law School. Despite having no prior training in biology, along with my husband Eric Minikel I set out to re-train myself as a scientist and devote my life to searching for a treatment or cure for this disease. We quit our jobs in consulting, began taking night classes and attending conferences, crowdfunded money for research, found new jobs in research labs, and in 2014 enrolled as PhD students in biology at Harvard Medical School. 

Today, both Eric and I are based in Stuart Schreiber's laboratory at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and have launched a new therapeutic initiative to discover drugs for my disease. Here, we are using the clearly elucidated genetics of prion disease as our blueprint to therapeutic development. The fusion of our disease-specific focus with the broad-based drug discovery expertise of the Schreiber lab represents a new model of patient-powered precision medicine in action. 

Neurodegenerative diseases and rare diseases are both challenging categories for therapeutic development. Prion disease is both. However, we are immensely lucky to be standing on the shoulders of decades of prion basic science. From this vantage point, we can appreciate that for all their clinical complexity, these diseases are mechanistically driven by one gene, and one protein. We can map the intervention points in prion disease pathology that are logically supported by genetics and by robust experimental proofs of concept. Day to day in the lab, we are working in parallel to target each of these intervention points, from seeking to interrupt the biogenesis of the native prion protein to developing human cell-based systems to mechanism-agnostically assay for small molecules that inhibit prion propagation. 

By seizing my bad luck and diving into the science of my disease, I have come to appreciate just how fortunate we actually are. Even though as of 2016 we lack even one disease-modifying treatment for any neurodegenerative disease, prion diseases are endowed with a uniquely clear roadmap to treatment. By leveraging this information to wage a full-force attack on this one rare indication, we have the opportunity to set a new precedent for entire class of diseases. This is the power of predictive testing. We set out to change my fate. With the support of the Broad Institute and countless others who have joined our fight along the way, I believe we are within striking distance of changing history.

### Talk titles

Here are some common titles for talks we give:
