<p>In a meeting earlier this week I was finally able to get clarification on what all I&#8217;m looking at in the Allen Institute images <a href="/2012/03/25/mouse-brain-images-from-the-allen-institute-for-brain-science/">mentioned in a previous post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ISH images</strong></p>
<p>In these images, purkinje cells are stained purple, while granular cells are stained brown with hematoxylin (aka HE or H&amp;E).  Purkinje cells do not stain well with HE.  The white regions represent the &#8220;molecular layer&#8221;.  Note that in this series of sagittal sections, 17 is the midline and 1 is the outermost section, so 10-12 is around the region where damage to the thalamus from FFI would be most visible.   In the image below, (1) is the &#8220;arrow&#8221; characteristic of the hippocampus; the part of the thalamus immediately below it, labeled as (2), is the most affected in FFI.</p>

<div>Because FFI affects different brain regions to different extents (or at all), detecting damage requires knowing what part of the brain you&#8217;re looking at.  So one ultimate goal of my image segmentation project should be to identify the brain region.  One huge clue is the &#8220;arrow&#8221; (labeled &#8220;1&#8243; in the image above) characteristic of the hippocampus.</div>

<div><strong>mRNA expression images</strong></div>
<p>This series shows mRNA expression of a gene of your choice (PRNP in the example below) via a DIG stain where nitroblue tetrazoleum brings out a blue precipitate, and Tyramide Signal Amplification is used to read the image.   The images are paired with maps of the brain region you&#8217;re looking at.  These could also be used towards machine learning for identifying brain regions.   But mRNA expression won&#8217;t be especially useful for studying FFI because for PRNP <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12031342">Ford et al (2002) have found that mRNA and protein expression are uncorrelated</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>This series shows neuronal connections which will eventually be quite useful to us to figure out what the thalamus connects to:</p>
