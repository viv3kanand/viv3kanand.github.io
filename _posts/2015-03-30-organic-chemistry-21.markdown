*These are my notes from lecture 21 of Harvard's Chemistry 20: Organic Chemistry course, delivered by Dr. Ryan Spoering on March 30, 2015.*

### Bromoetherification

N-bromosuccinimide is a useful reagent:

Together with methanol, it can add bromine and ether to an alkene:

The mechanism is as follows:

In the process, it can also cyclize things:

### Bromolactonization

A lactone is a cyclic ester. Here is a five-membered ring example, though it could be any size ring:

NBS can be used to create bromated lactones from carboxylic acids, for instance:

### Ozonolysis

Ozone is a potent oxidant. It can be formed with an electrical arc in a stream of oxygen. Ozone can then be bubbled through a solution of an alkene. Ozone is a strong blue color in solution, and you'll see the blue go away as it reacts with your alkene. You then keep bubbling it in until the blue *persists*, meaning all of the alkene has been reacted. It will break an alkene into two carbonyl compounds, like so:

The "workup" can be either reductive (with Me<sub>2</sub>S) or oxidative (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which determines whether you end up with (respectively) an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid at the end:

The reductive workup is almost always what's used, because aldehydes are more useful synthetic intermediates than carbonxylic acids are.

The mechanism begins with dipolar cycloaddition followed by rearrangement to yield a secondary ozonide:

The mechanism of the reductive workup is then as follows:

In other words, you get the two benzaldehyde molecules out in two sequential steps, also producing DMSO as a byproduct. 

Here are two surprising examples where ozonolysis is useful in synthesis:

### Diol cleavage

Sodium periodate (NaIO<sub>4</sub>) is used for cleavage of 1,2 diols.

It is one alternate way (besides ozonolysis) to achieve the cleavage of 1,2 diphenylethylene into two benzaldehydes:

In the process of catalyzing this reaction, the iodine loses a double-bonded oxygen, gains a lone pair and thus changes its oxidation state from VII to V (a 2e<sup>-</sup> reduction of iodine).
