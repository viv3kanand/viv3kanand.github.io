<p>CureFFI.org came down with a nasty case of malware during Hurricane Sandy and it took us a while to get all the content restored, so depending when you visited over the past two weeks, you may have seen the site 404ed or, worse yet, parked with advertisements.  No more!  We&#8217;re back and we have a new look and lots more content to add over the coming weeks.  Check back soon, and also look for updates on our sister site <a title="Prion Alliance" href="http://www.prionalliance.org/">PrionAlliance.org</a>.</p>
