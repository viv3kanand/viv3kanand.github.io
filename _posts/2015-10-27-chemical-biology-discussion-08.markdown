*These are my notes from discussion section number 8 of Harvard's Chemistry 101: Chemical Biology Towards Precision Medicine course, taught by Edward Harvey and Chris Gerry on October 27, 2015.*

### General Q&A

Q. What is click chemistry?

A. For more background, see [[Kolb 2001], [Hein 2008]]. These sort of reactions were originally achieved through Cu or Ru catalysts, but these are toxic. Caroline Lubertozzi (sp?) developed a catalyst-free system using a cyclooctyne and an azide. Alkynes really want to be perfectly linear, so being part of the 8-membered ring introduces strain, which the reaction relieves, thus making it favorable without a catalyst. This is often called bioorthogonal labeling because these are groups you never see in biological systems.

Q. Besides the blood-brain barrier, what other barriers are difficult for small molecules to cross?

A. There are several important barriers, here is a list for orally delivered drugs:

1. **Stomach** - acidic (pH = 1) environment
2. **Small intestine** - permeability through gut wall
3. **Liver** - metabolic enzymes in the liver sometimes will add hydrophilic groups to make it rapidly excreted
4. **Blood supply** - must permeate capillary pores (90-150&Aring; diameter)
5. **Cell membrane** Upon reaching target tissue, the compound must permeate the cell membrane. Usually this is just passive diffusion through the phospholipid bilayer; there are a small minority of drugs that hijack active transporters.

Intravenous administration bypasses 1, 2, and to some extent 3. Drugs for extracellular proteins don't need to worry about 5.

### Challenges in neglected tropical diseases

The reading for today is [[Burrows 2014]], which discusses current challenges for chemical biology and diversity oriented synthesis in enabling drug discovery in neglected tropical diseases.

Leishmaniasis is a protozoal parasite that lives inside lysosomes in human macrophages. Current standard of care drugs such as [miltefosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miltefosine) have considerable adverse effects, and many of them, such as [meglumine antimoniate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meglumine_antimoniate) have to be given intravenously and contain antimony (Sb) which can accumulate to toxic levels in the patient's tissues.
