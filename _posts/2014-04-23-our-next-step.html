<p>After months of flying around to various schools and dashing around town meeting with potential advisors, collaborators, and allies, Sonia and I have made a decision that surprises both of us. We&#8217;re staying in Boston and starting PhDs at Harvard Medical School (the <a href="https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/BBS/">BBS</a> program) this fall.</p>
<p>A few months ago, when we started the PhD application process, we would have said that working in a prion lab (which Harvard lacks) was our first &#8211; perhaps only &#8211; priority. Recent experiences have very gradually changed our minds. We started out with a very concrete list of what projects we wanted to pursue in grad school, and that list has undergone almost 100% turnover in the past two months, thanks largely to experiences we&#8217;ve had within about a a 5 km radius of our current workplace at Massachusetts General Hospital. We went to a CRISPR workshop at the Broad Institute, attended a lecture by Adriano Aguzzi at the Whitehead Institute, had brainstorming sessions with George Church and with Susan Lindquist. The Boston/Cambridge biotechnology hub has an unfathomable capacity to seed new ideas. And so, bit by bit, we let go of our conviction that being in a prion lab was a necessity, and came to think that our greatest contribution to the prion field could actually be to stay right where we are, and bring big ideas from the Harvard/MIT/Broad axis to bear on our disease of interest.</p>
<p>This will mean lots of collaborations with prion labs, so we&#8217;re looking forward to maintaining friendships and working relationships across the prion field.</p>
<p>As we embark on the next phase of our quest for prion therapeutics, please wish us luck, and stay in touch. </p>
