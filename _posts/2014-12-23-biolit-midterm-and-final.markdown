---

With permission from course instructor [Mike Blower](http://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/laboratories/blower) I am posting my midterm and final papers from Harvard's BBS 230: Analysis of the Biological Literature. I figured these might be useful to future students wanting an example of what a midterm/final for this class looks like.

+ [**Midterm paper**](/media/2014/12/eric-minikel-bbs-230-midterm.pdf). For the midterm we were asked to write a ten-page reaction to [[Foltz 2009]].
+ [**Final paper**](/media/2014/12/eric-minikel-bbs-230-final-with-comments.pdf). For the final we were asked to write a ten-page reaction to [[Baker 2011]]. The paper I've posted is the Track Changed version with the comments I received from Dr. Blower.
