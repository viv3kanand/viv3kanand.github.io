If you've ever tried to make an R plot with transparency:

~~~r
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(iris, aes(x = factor(Species), y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.4)
~~~

But had the plot come out like this:

![Missing Semi-Transparency in R]({{ site.url }}/assets/missing-semi-transparency-r.png){: .center-image }

With the following error message:

~~~
Warning message:
In grid.Call.graphics(L_polygon, x$x, x$y, index) :
  semi-transparency is not supported on this device: reported only once per page
~~~

The issue has to do with the graphics device you are using. Specifically, the 
graphics device doesn't support semi-transparency. There have been several 
threads on this issue already:

* [How to set cairo as default backend for x11() in R?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10777008/how-to-set-cairo-as-default-backend-for-x11-in-r)
* [Semi-transparency in RStudio](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22581567/semi-transparency-in-rstudio)
* [how do i preserve transparency in ggplot2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4001316/how-do-i-preserve-transparency-in-ggplot2)

I was able to solve this issue by switching over to use the Cairo graphics 
device. Make sure you first install the [Cairo R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Cairo/index.html). 

~~~r
install.packages("Cairo")
~~~

Once you have that installed, place the following in your ~/.Rprofile ([code is from this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10777008/how-to-set-cairo-as-default-backend-for-x11-in-r)).

~~~r
setHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),
function(...) grDevices::X11.options(type='cairo'))
options(device='x11')
~~~

This makes it so that your default graphics device is set to Cairo whenever you 
start a new R session. Now open a new R session, and try the same plotting code 
(from above). You should see a plot with transparency now like this:

![Semi-Transparency in R]({{ site.url }}/assets/semi-transparency-r.png){: .center-image }

If you want to save this plot, you will need to use a Cairo-based graphics device:

~~~r
ggsave("semi-transparency-r.png", device = CairoPNG)
~~~
