<p>We have founded a new nonprofit organization, Prion Alliance, devoted to finding a treatment or cure for human prion diseases.  Check out our brand new website at <a href="http://www.prionalliance.org">PrionAlliance.org</a> and <a title="Contact Us" href="/contact-us-2/">let us know what you think</a>.  Going forward, PrionAlliance.org will be the organization&#8217;s official website, and CureFFI.org will continue to be an informal forum for discussing the latest research and sharing ideas and methodologies.</p>
