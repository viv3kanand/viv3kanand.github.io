<p>At <a href="http://prion2013.ca">Prion2013</a>, <a href="http://www.prioncentre.ca/people/westaway.php">David Westaway</a> and Charlie Mays gave an excellent talk and poster, respectively, on their work demonstrating that PrPC is downregulated during prion infection.</p>

<p><em>Charlie Mays with his poster on PrP<sup>C</sup> downregulation.</em></p>
<p>The backstory is that a couple of years ago, Westaway and <a href="http://mri.montana.edu/george-carlson-director-and-professor.html">George Carlson</a> discovered that Shadoo (gene: SPRN), a PrP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)#Paralogy">paralog</a> named for being a &#8216;shadow of prion protein&#8217;, is downregulated during prion infection [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219720/">Westaway 2011</a>].  This change is strictly post-translational &#8211; mRNA is not affected.  The change happens about halfway through the incubation time <em>in vivo</em> and is fairly dramatic, with Shadoo levels reduced by about half.  The authors&#8217; hypothesis to explain this result is that once PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulates to a certain level, the cell mounts a response, possibly a storm of proteases intended to shear up PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, but that since much of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is protease resistant, it escapes relatively unscathed, while its paralog Shadoo bears the brunt of the response.  Westaway showed a nice Pac-Man drawing of this hypothesis in his talk, which I attempt to duplicate here:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1zxtPcbh5LDgxntUvoF5I9UykKUbUA0luo2sO1Sbwvls/pub?w=343&amp;h=174"/></p>
<p>This gives rise to an obvious question: if this hypothesized protease response is nonspecific enough to hit Shadoo, shouldn&#8217;t it hit PrP<sup>C</sup> as well?</p>
<p>Indeed, it does. Mays and Westaway showed compelling evidence that PrP<sup>C</sup> is posttranslationally downregulated by about half, sometime around halfway through prion infection.  This effect was pretty consistently observed across several different models, though there were a couple of transgenic mouse lines in which it failed to show up.</p>
<p>One audience member asked if this could be just &#8220;mass action&#8221;, i.e. there&#8217;s less PrP<sup>C</sup> left because so much is converted to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>?  No &#8211; Westaway pointed out that decades ago it was shown by metabolic labeling (incorporation of radiolabeled <sup>35</sup>S methionine into PrP) that no more than 3% PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules synthesized ultimately become PrP-res [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1680859">Caughey &amp; Raymond 1991</a> (<a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/266/27/18217.full.pdf">ft</a>)].  Dr. Stanley Prusiner asked Westaway how he knew it wasn&#8217;t just selective loss of PrP-expressing neurons.  For this the main line of evidence seemed to be that the downregulation occurs early enough that little to no neuronal loss is yet observed.</p>
<p>So the effect seems to be real.  This offers the tantalizing possibility of finding some pharmacological means of activating this supposed protease response even earlier or more dramatically, thus <a title="The case for depleting PrP as a therapeutic strategy against prion diseases" href="/2013/04/08/the-case-for-depleting-prp-as-a-therapeutic-strategy-against-prion-diseases/">depleting</a> the PrP<sup>C</sup> substrate for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion.  Later in the day I asked Westaway for his thoughts on this idea, and he wholeheartedly agreed it was a promising route.  Their current work is aimed in part at understanding exactly what process/protein/response is activated that leads to increased PrP<sup>C</sup> (and Shadoo) downregulation.</p>
<p>Besides its therapeutic potential, this may also be a big step forward in our understanding of the basic science of prions.  The researchers postulate that this response is a key reason for the inherently slow nature of prion infections &#8211; just when PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production is ramping up, its substrate gets depleted by half.  It&#8217;s also seemingly the first evidence that our cells aren&#8217;t so dumb after all &#8211; we may not have an immune response to prion infection, but we <em>do</em> have some sort of mechanism in place for detecting the accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and mounting a response.</p>
<p>This result also led to some interesting discussion of the kinetics of prion propagation. Westaway argued that the downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> could help to explain the fact that infectivity plateaus midway through disease progression [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6801762">Prusiner 1982</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350487">Sandberg 2011</a>].  Mays and Westaway did also observe eIF2α phosphorylation, though only at the terminal stage, somewhat later than observed by [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378208/">Moreno 2012</a>].  There were a lot of other details I didn&#8217;t catch or fully understand &#8211; but hopefully this work will be published soon.</p>
