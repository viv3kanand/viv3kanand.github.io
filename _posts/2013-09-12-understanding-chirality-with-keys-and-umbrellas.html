<p>Last week, shopping around for a night school class, I went to introductory lectures on organic chemistry and biochemistry and was introduced, again, to the concept of <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)">chirality</a></strong>, which I&#8217;ve never understood.  The idea is that for an atom bonded to four different R groups, there are two different orderings of the R groups.  This should be simple enough and there are plenty of good tutorials on it online, including this Khan Academy lecture:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.khanacademy.org/embed_video?v=tk-SNvCPLCE" height="355" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>But I must just have poor 3-D spatial reasoning skills.   I simply couldn&#8217;t wrap my mind around how the two &#8220;orderings&#8221; of atoms in 3-D space could be fundamentally different.</p>
<p>After all,  I figured, there is only one way to arrange three keys on a keychain.  Although there are 3! = 6 orderings of keys, rotation makes 3 of them identical and flipping the keychain over makes 2 of them identical, thus 3!/3/2 = 1.  I illustrate this using my flashlight, <a href="http://www.thehubway.com/">Hubway</a> RFID keyfob, and one actual key.  Here are three rotations:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/keys.rotated.side1_.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2872" alt="keys.rotated.side1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/keys.rotated.side1_.png"/></a></p>
<p>And by flipping it over and rotating again, here are the other three permutations:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/keys.rotated.side2_.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2873" alt="keys.rotated.side2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/keys.rotated.side2_.png"/></a></p>
<p>A chiral atom has four R groups, not three, but it also gets to move in 3 dimensions, not just 2.  I just couldn&#8217;t picture what it <em>means</em> for the 4 R groups to have fundamentally different orderings.  So I tried rotating a molecule 120° at a time, sort of like I was rotating the keys.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chirality.rotated.1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2874" alt="chirality.rotated.1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chirality.rotated.1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And I got three rotations, but sure enough, you just can&#8217;t get the 2-4-3 ordering with the 1 on top through any rotation in three dimensions.  Instead, I realized, the equivalent of flipping the keychain would be to flip the molecule inside out like Boston windstorms have done to so many umbrellas:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/umbrella.inside.out_.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2875" alt="umbrella.inside.out" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/umbrella.inside.out_.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>By which I mean, pointing the 2, 3, and 4 prongs of the tetrahedron upward and having the 1 stick out the bottom.  If you do this to the original molecule and then rotate it around again, you can indeed get the 2-4-3 configuration:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chirality.insideout.rotate.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2877" alt="chirality.insideout.rotate" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chirality.insideout.rotate.png"/></a></p>
<p>And then if you rotate this, you do indeed get all three other rotations of the 2, 3 and 4:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chirality.rotated.2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2878" alt="chirality.rotated.2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chirality.rotated.2.png"/></a></p>
<p>The catch, of course, is that the umbrella-like inversion of the molecule is not just a rotation in 3-D space.  Flipping it inside out makes it a different molecule &#8211; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer">enantiomer</a> of the original molecule.  In fact, this act of turning a chiral molecule inside out is precisely what happens in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN2_reaction">SN2 reactions</a> (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN1_reaction">SN1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E1_elimination#E1_mechanism">E1</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E2_elimination">E2</a>).</p>
<p>So to go back to the key analogy, having the 1 anchored at the top is equivalent to if you considered your keychain to have &#8220;sidedness&#8221;, in which case there would indeed be chirality to your keychain.</p>
<p>My next question was why I&#8217;ve heard people say that everything in biology has the same chirality.  Isn&#8217;t it totally arbitrary which version of a molecule we call which?  In what meaningful sense are biomolecules of the same chirality?</p>
<p>In the following sense: in all of the 20 (or 21 or 22) canonical, genetically encoded amino acids, the R group is in the same position relative to the COO<sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>3<sup>+</sup></sub> and H groups.  This particular configuration happens to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrorotation_and_levorotation">L</a>, meaning it rotates light counterclockwise.   Biological sugars, on the other hand, are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrorotation_and_levorotation">D</a> and rotate light clockwise.</p>
<p>A molecules&#8217; D or L light-rotating properties are difficult to predict and have often been determined experimentally.  Without knowing whether a molecule is D or L, there is still a convention called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules">Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules</a> for calling a molecule R or S based on the ordering of the molecular weights of the attached groups.</p>
<p>Chirality was <a href="http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ny-Pi/Pasteur-Louis.html">discovered by Louis Pasteur</a> examining crystals of tartaric acid in wine.  A crystal seed of one chirality will only precipitate from solution molecules of its same chirality, so you can end up with macroscopic crystals of all one chirality.</p>
<p>PS. Given that I had trouble visualizing this 3-D phenomenon, imagine how flummoxed I was by Adam Bliss&#8217;s <a href="http://rapidraven.com/stereo/#WIDTH=400&amp;HEIGHT=400&amp;EYE_SEPARATION=300&amp;EYE_Z=1500&amp;EYE_W=250&amp;SIZE=50&amp;SPEED=1&amp;DELAY=0.016&amp;QWERTY=1&amp;REFLECT=0&amp;">stereographic projections of a hypercube</a>!</p>
