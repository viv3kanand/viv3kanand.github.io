<p>Last year, I blogged a general introduction to <a href="/2013/06/26/proteolysis-of-prion-protein-in-the-central-region-alpha-and-beta-cleavage/" title="Proteolysis of prion protein in the central region: alpha and beta cleavage">alpha and beta cleavage</a>, two events in the proteolytic processing of PrP. While the paradigm introduced in that post remains broadly correct, some refinements may be in order following recent work from Glenn Millhauser&#8217;s group [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24247244">McDonald 2014</a>]. While there are implications for beta cleavage and <a href="/2013/06/29/proteolytic-shedding-of-prion-protein/" title="Proteolytic shedding of prion protein">shedding</a> as well, to me the most interesting part was the new view of alpha cleavage. I&#8217;ve attempted to diagram a subset of the findings below.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used human numbering and sequence, though the study used recombinant MoPrP. The study was done entirely <em>in vitro</em> with purified ingredients, and the relative prevalence of the new cleavage events <em>in vivo</em> remains to be confirmed. The study finds that there are actually three distinct types of alpha cleavage &#8211; &alpha;1, which we already knew about, plus &alpha;2 and &alpha;3 which occur a few residues further to the C terminus. In general, ADAM8 can perform &beta; or &alpha; cleavage, but it seems to not like to cut at sites where a metal ion is bound, so introduction of a bit of copper, which occupies the octarepeats with higher affinity, reduces beta cleavage and shifts ADAM8 toward &alpha; cleavage. (Zinc does the same). Introduction of even more copper leads to occupancy of H111, which shifts the balance away from &alpha;1 and towards &alpha;2 cleavage. In recombinant MoPrP with the equivalent of the D178N or E200K mutations, the ability of copper to stimulate &alpha;2 cleavage is largely abolished. That&#8217;s interesting because other recent work from Millhauser&#8217;s group suggests that these mutants, which increase charge on a C-terminal face of the protein, reduce the inclination of PrP&#8217;s N terminus to interact with that face [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570608/">Spevacek 2013</a>].</p>
<p>If all that sounds like a lot of specifics, the big picture here is that this paints a picture whereby PrP proteolysis is regulated by the presence of metal ions. Alpha cleavage, mind you, is conserved at least out to chickens [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8093841">Harris 1993</a>], and seems to be required to prevent the peripheral demyelination phenotype of PrP knockout mice [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20098419">Bremer 2010</a>], so it must be intimately related to a native function of PrP. </p>
<p>In a new review in <em>Prion</em>, Millhauser argues that alpha cleavage might be a general mechanism for keeping PrP&#8217;s activity in check, and speculates that the neurotoxicity of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> might arise from an uncontrolled exaggeration of such activity when alpha cleavage is impaired [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721836">McDonald &#038; Millhauser 2014</a>].</p>
<p>What &#8220;activity,&#8221; you ask? PrP has been shown to interact with a number of different glutamate receptors including AMPA [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23072804">Watt 2013</a>], NMDA [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22307640">You 2012</a>] and mGluR5 [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012003">Um 2013</a>], so Millhauser uses as one specific example the concept [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23072804">Watt 2013</a>] that PrP helps load zinc into the AMPA receptor for uptake into cells. When zinc is present, PrP&#8217;s N terminus interacts with AMPA and the octarepeats provide zinc for import into the cytosol; but zinc also changes PrP&#8217;s tertiary structure in a way that makes it more accessible to alpha cleavage [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570608/">Spevacek 2013</a>], so that ADAM8 begins to cleave PrP, preventing the cell from being flooded with too much zinc.</p>
<p>If true, whether of AMPA and/or other interacting partners of PrP, this sort of story would elegantly tie together a few different observations. As Millhauser points out, the <a href="/2014/04/29/structural-mutants-of-prp/" title="Structural mutants of PrP">interstitital deletion mutants</a> of PrP that cause spontaneous cerebellar degeneration are, without exception, those which abolish all of the alpha cleavage sites while leaving the N terminus intact. The &#8220;partial agonist&#8221; &Delta;114-121, which isn&#8217;t toxic on its own but also isn&#8217;t as good as PrP<sup>C</sup> at rescuing the toxicity of other mutants, lacks two of three alpha cleavage sites. In PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, residues beyond 90 are often sequestered into proteinase K-resistant aggregates (and presumably first into lower-order oligomers), plausibly occluding the alpha cleavage sites from ADAM8&#8242;s reach.</p>
<p>Millhauser&#8217;s theory also seems to be reasonably compatible with other observations and other theories of PrP neurotoxicity. It certainly meshes with toxicity being mediated by PrP&#8217;s N terminal flexible tail [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23903654">Sonati 2013</a>], and the theory of an undampened interaction with AMPA or other channels is consistent with the spontaneous transmembrane currents observed in &Delta;CR cells [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924115/">Solomon 2010</a>]. And the theory leads to some testable hypotheses. If loss of alpha cleavage is responsible for the phenotype of &Delta;CR and other interstitial deletion mutants, then a shorter deletion, &Delta;110-121 in human sequence, which barely encompasses the three alpha cleavage sites, should be sufficient to recapitulate the &Delta;CR phenotype. Suppression of alpha cleavage by combining missense mutations &#8211; H111Y, V121D, and conversion of one or two alanines to aspartate in the palindromic sequnence in PrP should accomplish the same.</p>
<p>Granted, even if alpha cleavage is a key player here, that still doesn&#8217;t complete the story &#8211; the toxicity of globular domain ligands such as POM1 demands that some conformational change in PrP<sup>C</sup> is also required to induce the toxic &#8220;overdrive&#8221; [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23903654">Sonati 2013</a>]. There is a lot we don&#8217;t understand. And because &Delta;23-88 mice &#8211; lacking almost all of the N terminus of PrP &#8211; can still get fatal prion disease [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11152514/">Supattapone 2001</a>], N terminal toxicity in all its forms simply cannot be the sole mechanism of neurotoxicity in prion disease &#8211; but that&#8217;s a topic for another post.</p>
