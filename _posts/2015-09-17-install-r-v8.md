title:  "Installing the V8 R Package - \"No package 'libv8' found\""
tags: [R, v8]

I recently tried to install the V8 R package on my Mac running Yosemite using `install.packages("V8")` only to run into this problem.

~~~
* installing *source* package 'V8' ...
** package 'V8' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
Package libv8 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing 'libv8.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'libv8' found
Using PKG_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/v8-315/include
Using PKG_LIBS=-L/usr/local/opt/v8-315/lib -lv8
------------------------- ANTICONF ERROR ---------------------------
Configuration failed because libv8 was not found. Try installing:
 * deb: libv8-3.14-dev | libv8-dev (Debian, Ubuntu)
 * rpm: v8-devel (Fedora, EPEL)
 * brew: v8-315 (OSX) -- NOT regular v8! Tap from homebrew/versions
 * csw: libv8_dev (Solaris)
If libv8 is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a libv8.pc file. If pkg-config
is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'

The problem was a missing v8 library. You can get this from homebrew, but you need to make sure you specifically get the v8-315 library. It tells you this in the error message:

> brew: v8-315 (OSX) -- NOT regular v8! Tap from homebrew/versions

To do this, you use the following commands:

~~~bash
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew install v8-315
~~~

Once this is installed, you can try `install.packages("V8")` again and it should work.

If you already have the V8 library installed through brew then it will not automatically link the v8-315 library. This could cause problems and so it would be wise to actually unlink it using:

~~~bash
brew unlink v8
~~~

Then run

~~~bash
brew link v8-315
~~~
