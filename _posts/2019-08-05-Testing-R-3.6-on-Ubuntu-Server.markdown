---

_I think I was tryharding to get into writing my first post on this blog. In fact, I was looking for the right topic to start with. It didn't work that way. Lately I was fixing the server which has some R version conflict. So I gave it a go, finally!!_

So recently I was been doing a lot of RNA-Seq analysis and my Workstation hanged up because of the load. That's when I decided to migrate to server. It had an [R version 2.15.3](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/) pre-installed. Then I installed [Rstudio-server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/) (Pretty basic installation), which makes my life a lot easier.

Most of the Packages for RNA-Seq analysis are from [bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/). So I started installing __BiocManager__ (A linker to download bioconductor packages).

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
```

However, it was throwing an error
`package 'biocmanager' is not available (for r version 2.15.3)`.

The problem was bioconductor updated to [version 3.9](https://www.bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_9_release/).

>We are pleased to announce Bioconductor 3.9, consisting of 1741 software https://www.bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_9_release/packages, 371 experiment data packages, 948 annotation packages, and 27 workflows.
>There are 105 new software packages, 13 new data experiment packages, 4 new workflows, and many updates and improvements to existing packages; __Bioconductor 3.9 is compatible with R 3.6.0__, and is supported on Linux, 32- and 64-bit Windows, and Mac OS X. This release will include an updated Bioconductor Amazon Machine Image and Docker containers.

So it's a compatibility issue. I just had to install the R version 3.6. Simple!

I found this handy tutorial from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html)

#### Uninstall current version of R completely

`sudo apt-get autoremove r-base r-base-devel`

#### Find the right source for the Ubuntu version

>As of November 18, 2018 the supported releases are __Xenial Xerus (16.04; LTS)__, Trusty Tahr (14.04; LTS), Bionic Beaver (18.04;LTS), Cosmic Cuttlefish (18.10), and Disco Dingo (19.04)

So Xenial is the right version for me since I'm using Ubuntu version 16.04. Xenial-cran35 for R verson 3.6.

#### Add source to repository

`sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial-cran35/'`

##### OR

`sudo echo "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial-cran35/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list`

#### Add keys

`gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9`

`gpg -a --export E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -`

##### Just in case if firewall blocking port 11371

`gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9`

`gpg -a --export E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -`

They have mentioned many more methods. Feel free to explore yourself.

#### Update and install

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev`

Generally, everything will be sorted out by now

#### Read below if you messed up with the installation

Welcome to the club! We all do silly mistakes. This is just beacuse you did some mistake in the beginning and added a non-compatible repository `Trusty Tahr (14.04; LTS), Bionic Beaver (18.04;LTS), Cosmic Cuttlefish (18.10) or Disco Dingo (19.04)` on a 16.04 ubuntu, it will throw another error in installation. And this may still cause a problem even if you redo the whole thing with the right repositories. It is because the `sources.list` file will still have the previous repositories added in it. It can be easily be resolved by commenting few lines in the `sources.list` file.

You can do the following 

`vi /etc/apt/sources.list`

And go to the bottom of the file.

```bash
## Uncomment the following two lines to add software from Canonical's
## 'partner' repository.
## This software is not part of Ubuntu, but is offered by Canonical and the
## respective vendors as a service to Ubuntu users.
# deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu xenial partner
# deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu xenial partner

deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main restricted
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security universe
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security multiverse
deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial stable
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu disco-cran35/
deb-src https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu disco-cran35/
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/
deb-src https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial-cran35/
```

As you can see, there are few other versions along with the `xenial-cran35` version. 

Comment the lines match with the link we added to the repository earlier. In my case I have tried with `disco-cran35` which is meant for `Ubuntu 19.04`. Another mistake was I made was adding `xenial` which was for `R version 3.4`. And new bioconductor works only for R version 3.6 and above. Then went back to `xenial-cran35`. Problems of not following the tutorial properly >_>

```bash
## Uncomment the following two lines to add software from Canonical's
## 'partner' repository.

# deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/
# deb-src https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial-cran35/
```

I commented both of them. Then update and install again. Finally, there you have R version 3.6.
