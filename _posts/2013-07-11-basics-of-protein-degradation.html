<p><strong>introduction</strong></p>
<p>My <a href="/tag/bios-e-16">cell biology class</a> didn&#8217;t include a thorough introduction to how proteins get degraded, so I did some reading recently to get the very basics.  There are really only two major, fundamentally different mechanisms by which animal cells degrade proteins: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome">lysosome</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome">proteasome</a> [introduced in Cooper 2000 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9957/">Protein Degradation</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9953/">Lysosome</a> chapters, also reviewed in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670399/">Mizushima 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17088581">Reinstein &amp; Ciechanover 2006</a> (<a href="http://apspersonify.org/mm/Publications/Journals/PIM/reinstein-pdf.pdf">ft</a>)].</p>
<p>Both of these are thought to be involved in the degradation of PrP.  A forthcoming post will discuss the evidence for how PrP is degraded.  First, this post will first introduce the basics of these two types of degradation machinery.</p>
<p><strong>lysosome</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome">lysosome</a> is a membrane-bound intracellular compartment full of nonspecific proteases that will cleave into individual amino acids any protein they come into contact with.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump">Proton pumps</a> fill the lysosome with H+ from the cytosol, making it acidic (pH 4.8) — the proteases function optimally at this pH and not at all at cytosolic pH (7.2), thus minimizing the risk to the cell in the event of lysosome rupture.  The lysosome is formed by budding off from a compartment of the late Golgi &#8211; it represents an alternate endpoint for some proteins in the secretory pathway that neither stay in the ER or Golgi nor undergo exocytosis to the cell surface.</p>
<p>Proteins destined for lysosomal degradation can reach the lysosome by a variety of means.  Following <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9831/#_A2021_">receptor-mediated endocytosis</a>, endocytic vesicles from the cell surface can fuse with the lysosome; this is a mechanism for degradation of cell surface receptors and thus the downregulation of incoming signals [Cooper 2000 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9831/">Endocytosis</a> chapter].  In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a>, the cell engulfs foreign bodies &#8211; say, invading bacteria, or apoptotic bodies from other cells &#8211; and delivers them to the lysosome.  The membrane of the lysosome itself can invaginate, creating exosome-like vesicles full of cytosolic proteins to be degraded.  In &#8220;canonical&#8221;, starvation-induced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy">autophagy</a>, double membrane forms around material (such as unneeded organelles) in the cytosol and delivers them to the lysosome.  The degradation of proteins in the lysosomes is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolic">catabolic</a> &#8211; it releases energy &#8211; so this response to nutrient starvation recovers some of the energy originally put into synthesizing proteins and other cellular components.  But autophagy isn&#8217;t induced only by starvation &#8211; unfolded protein stress in the endoplasmic reticulum can cause chunks of ER to be degraded by autophagy [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1661684/">Bernales 2006</a>].</p>
<p>A word about vocabulary: I find that in practice the use of the term &#8220;autophagy&#8221; is highly promiscuous.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9839/">Cooper 2000</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/cooper/A2886/def-item/A2926/">defines autophagy</a> narrowly, as &#8220;the degradation of cytoplasmic proteins and organelles by their enclosure in vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum that fuse with lysosomes&#8221;.  But others use autophagy interchangeably with lysosomal degradation &#8211; for instance, &#8220;The major pathways for degradation of cellular constituents are autophagy and cytosolic turnover by the proteasome&#8221; [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732363/">Klionsky &amp; Emr 2000</a>].  The journal <em>Autophagy</em> includes a wide variety of pathways and processes in <a href="http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/autophagy/about/">its purview</a>.  The only lysosomal degradation pathway I <em>haven&#8217;t</em> ever seen called autophagy is phagocytosis, perhaps since the engulfment and degradation of <em>foreign</em> bodies doesn&#8217;t match the <em>auto </em>in <em>auto</em>phagy.</p>
<p><strong>proteasome</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome">proteasome</a> is a cylindrical protein complex found in the cytosol which cleaves up proteins tagged with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin">ubiquitin</a>.  To accomplish this, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin-activating_enzyme">E1</a> enzyme activates a ubiquitin molecule, transfers it to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin-conjugating_enzyme">E2</a> enzyme, and finally an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase">E3</a> ubiquitin ligase covalently attaches ubiquitin to a lysine (K) on the protein to be degraded.  There are a huge variety of different E3 ubiquitin ligases, reflecting the many different regulatory pathways by which the cell selects and recognizes proteins it wants to flag for degradation.</p>
<p>The proteasome itself weighs in at 26<a title="a nonlinear unit used to measure large protein complexes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svedberg">S</a>, and is composed of a 19S gate and a 20S core.  The 19S gate recognizes and binds ubiquitinated proteins, powered by ATP &#8211; unlike the lysosome, the proteasome is an energy-losing operation.  Once recognized, these proteins must be de-ubiquitinated and unfold in order to pass through the narrow channel of the 19S and enter the 20S core, a cylindrical complex which does the actual chopping up of proteins.  Unlike the lysosome, where proteases shear proteins up into individual amino acids, the proteasome just chops proteins into small peptides, usually of 7 &#8211; 9 amino acids each.  These are later broken into amino acids by cytosolic proteases [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17088581">Reinstein &amp; Ciechanover 2006</a> (<a href="http://apspersonify.org/mm/Publications/Journals/PIM/reinstein-pdf.pdf">ft</a>)].</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s located in the cytosol, the proteasome has immediate access to degrade cytosolic proteins.  However, its action is not limited to cytosolic substrates.  Just as proteins can be translocated <em>into</em> the <a title="Cell Biology 04: The Secretory Pathway" href="/2013/02/24/cell-biology-04-the-secretory-pathway/">secretory pathway</a>, they can also be retrotranslocated back <em>out</em> in order to be degraded by the proteasome.  This process is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated_protein_degradation">ER-associated degradation</a> or ERAD.  As of today <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated_protein_degradation#Retro-translocation_into_the_cytosol">it is not actually known</a> what the channel is that allows for retrotranslocation across the ER membrane.</p>
