<p>Good news: after months of dabbling in lay science in my spare time and on this blog, I have finally left my job in consulting and landed a job as a legit scientist in a neurobiology lab, working primarily on Huntington&#8217;s disease (HD).  As a genetic neurodegenerative protein-folding disease, it&#8217;s got a lot in common with Fatal Familial Insomnia, so my hope is that I&#8217;ll be learning a lot of relevant biology and skills as I go.  Toward that end, I expect to be blogging about a lot of what I learn here at cureffi.org.  Expect to see a lot of posts about gene therapy, computational methods, stem cells, and a host of other topics relevant to both diseases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s inspiring to be working on HD, both as an opportunity to learn and as an opportunity to contribute to solving this disease.  And as I learned this morning at the Hereditary Disease Foundation&#8217;s HD2010 conference, there is quite a large community of people worldwide, and especially in Boston, working on HD.  It is a rather well-organized and well-funded endeavor and, beyond the science itself, may hold a lot of lessons for prion disease research in the organizational realm as well.</p>
