<p>These are notes from lecture 2 of <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/introduction-biochemistry">Harvard Extension&#8217;s biochemistry class</a>.</p>
<p><strong>biological buffering</strong></p>
<p>The bicarbonate system maintains blood pH.</p>
<p>lung CO<sub>2</sub> ↔ blood CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ↔ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ↔ H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></p>
<p>So when you get too much CO<sub>2</sub> your blood pH drops, triggering a &#8220;blow off&#8221; CO<sub>2</sub> response.</p>

<em>*At physiological pH</em><br/>
<em>**Histidine&#8217;s pKa is very close to physiological pH, so it is sometimes protonated (and therefore positively charged) and sometimes not</em></p>
<p>Each amino acid has a particular pK<sub>a</sub> for <em>each</em> of its -COOH and -NH3+; many also have a pKa for their R group.  pKa of COOH is usually ~2 and of NH3+ is usually ~9.5.  See <a href="http://www.cem.msu.edu/~cem252/sp97/ch24/ch24aa.html">this table of the pKas</a>.</p>
<p>All biological amino acids are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrorotation_and_levorotation">levorotary</a> (L-), except glycine which is a<a title="Understanding chirality with keys and umbrellas" href="/2013/09/12/understanding-chirality-with-keys-and-umbrellas/">chiral</a>.</p>
<p>In acid-base titration, amino acids will hit a wall where all the NH3+ is protonated and all the COO- is deprotonated, thus it is net neutral.  This is its isoelectric point or pI: the pH at which the net charge is zero.  &#8221;This&#8221; is called the Zwitterion.  ??  At pH &gt; pI, an AA is negatively charged; at pH &lt; pI, it is positively charged.</p>
<p>For AAs without an ionizable R group, the pI is ½(pK<sub>C</sub> + pK<sub>N</sub>).  For those with an ionizable group and pK<sub>R</sub> &lt; pK<sub>N</sub>, pI = ½*(pK<sub>C</sub> + pK<sub>R</sub>); if pK<sub>R</sub> &gt; pK<sub>N</sub>, pI = ½*(pK<sub>N</sub> + pK<sub>R</sub>).  (Note: she uses pK<sub>1</sub> to mean pK<sub>C</sub> and pK<sub>2</sub> to mean pK<sub>N</sub>).</p>
<p>Proteins of &lt; 40 aa are called &#8220;oligopeptides&#8221;.  Those of MW &lt; 10 kDa are &#8220;polypeptides&#8221; and &gt; 10 kDa are &#8220;proteins&#8221;.  Average amino acid molecular weight is ~110 Da, thus 10 kDa ~= 90 aa.</p>
<p>Peptide bonds have a resonance structure with O-, NH+ and a double bond C=N.  Thus there is some double bond character in a peptide bond, which prevents rotation around the C=N bond.  The C in COOH is called Cα; the C in the center of the tetrahedron is just called C. Ψ (Psi) is rotation around the C-αC bond. Φ (Phi) is rotation around the N-Cα bond.</p>
<p>Secondary structure requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must allow the polar peptide bond to hydrogen bond: O- to be a hydrogen bond acceptor, and NH+ to be a hydrogen bond donor.</li>
<li>Minimize steric strain.</li>
<li>Position side chains to minimize interference.  (Isn&#8217;t this also steric??)</li>
</ul>
<p>Two secondary structures meet these well: α-helices and β-sheets</p>
<p>α-helices are a spiral staircase where you walk up the staircase with your right hand on the outer railing and your left hand on the central pole. Rungs are 5.4 Å (3.6 aa) high to satisfy hydrogen bonding between one aa&#8217;s O- and another&#8217;s N+. Side chains point outward from the helix. R groups of amino acids affect their ability to participate in an α-helix. Because P has its R group covalently bonded to NH2+, it forces a kink in the chain which makes it very rare in helices. G, meanwhile, is too flexible and is therefore also rare in α-helices. Also too many negatives (e.g. EEEEE) or too many positives (e.g. KKKKK) repel each other and also cannot form a helix. Too many bulk proteins (N, T, Q) is also destabilizing.</p>
<p>β-sheets can be parallel (N→C, N→C, N→C) or antiparallel (N→C, C→N, N→C). The backbone hydrogen bonds are in between the strands. R groups within the sheets need to be small &#8211; G and A are common. There are on average 6 strands per β-sheet.</p>
<p>Irregular secondary structures called loops and β-turns link multiple helices or sheets. Loops link antiparallel sheets, β-turns link parallel sheets.</p>
<p>Globular proteins have a hydrophilic surface and a hydrophobic core. The core is rich in hydrophobic amino acids; any polar residues present there must hydrogen-bond to neutralize them, and charged residues must participate in ionic bonding. The core is rich in regular secondary structure &#8211; the internal hydrogen bonding of helices and sheets minimizes the chargedness. The surface is enriched for polar and charged amino acids.</p>
<p>A <em>motif</em> is a supersecondary structure &#8211; a pattern of ordering of sheets and helices. e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_key_(protein_structure)#Greek_key_motif">Greek key</a>.</p>
<p>A <i>domain </i>is a part of a peptide chain that is independently stable or can move as a single entity with respect to the rest of the protein.  The strict definition (?) is that if you separate 2 domains, each will retain its own individual structure.</p>
<p>Homo-oligomers (dimers, trimers, tetramers) have all subunits identical; hetero-oligomers have non-identical subunits.</p>
<p>A protein will fold into the &#8220;most thermodynamically stable&#8221; state (lowest Gibbs free energy).  The hydrophobic effect is the main driving force that drives protein folding.  A disordered (unfolded) peptide means ordered &#8220;caged water&#8221;.  Net entropy is actually <em>increased</em> by folding the protein and thus freeing the water from its cage.</p>
<p>Secondary to the hydrophobic effect, other thermodynamic forces also contribute to protein folding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Van der Waals, especially in the hydrophobic core of a globular protein</li>
<li>hydrogen bonding of R groups, though these don&#8217;t add much to the driving force because they can just as easily bond with water as with each other</li>
<li>ionic interactions or &#8220;salt bridges&#8221; between charged R groups.</li>
<li>covalent disulfide bonds, though these are primarily (only?) found in extracellular proteins (her explanation: the environment is harsher so the covalent bonds are needed to support the protein structure).</li>
</ul>
<p>Anifinsen (Nobel 1972) hypothesized that primary structure drives secondary and tertiary structure.  To test this he asked whether a protein denatured with urea and reduced (eliminating disulfide bonds) with beta mercaptoethanol will re-fold to its native conformation.  In the particular protein he studied, ribonuclease A, the answer happened to be yes.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that spontaneous protein folding involves 2 events: (1) almost-instant folding of local segments of secondary structure, and (2) hydrophobic collapse in a &#8220;molten globule.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thermodynamics of folding are sometimes described as a &#8220;funnel&#8221;.  As you fold, energy decreases but entropy also decreases, with many intermediates that are a local minimum but ultimately break and re-fold, until you get to the bottom of the well which is the &#8220;native structure.&#8221;</p>

<p>In reality many proteins require chaperones. One <a href="http://kc.njnu.edu.cn/swxbx/shuangyu/4.htm">example</a> is Hsp70 holding a protein unfolded until it can be transferred to Hsp60 which is visualized as a &#8220;cage&#8221; inside which the protein can fold.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;molten globule&#8221; stage between denatured and native states, a β-sheet rich protein can oligomerize to form amyloid fibrils.</p>
<p><strong>transport proteins</strong></p>
<p>O<sub>2</sub> is poorly soluble in aqueous solution and cannot diffuse more than a few mm. Therefore we evolved proteins to carry it.</p>
<p>Myoglobin has a &#8220;globin fold motif&#8221;. It is a polypeptide with eight &amp;alpha-helices and one heme group. It can store O<sub>2</sub> (a prominent role in cetaceans) or faciliate O<sub>2</sub> diffusion in muscle (a prominent role in land mammals). Heme is a porphyrin ring with four nitrogens coordinating one Fe<sup>2+</sup> which binds O<sub>2</sub>. It can only bind if the heme is exposed, not if the heme is buried in the protein. Myoglobin binding to O<sub>2</sub> follows a hyperbolic curve with partial pressure of oxygen on the x axis. At 2.8 torr, 50% of myoglobin is oxygen-bound &#8211; this is called a p<sub>50</sub> (by analogy to EC<sub>50</sub> in pharmcology?) The lower the p50, the greater the affinity of myoglobin for O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) is a heterotetramer made of 2 α globin subunits and 2 β globin subunits, each of which has one heme. Hemoglobin has a much higher p<sub>50</sub> than myoglobin. Hemoglobin gets saturated with oxygen in the lungs at 100 torr, then as the partial pressure of oxygen drops as you get further from the lungs, it sheds O<sub>2</sub>. Thus the lower affinity of hemoglobin than myoglobin is crucial for the former&#8217;s biological role of delivering oxygen.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin binding to oxygen actually follows a sigmoidal curve &#8211; it is &#8220;reluctant&#8221; to bind its first O<sub>2</sub> but once it does, that causes conformational change from a &#8220;tense&#8221; (T) state to a &#8220;relaxed&#8221; (R) state (in which the porphyrin is more planar) that increases affinity for additional O<sub>2</sub>. It binds its 4th O<sub>2</sub> with 100x the affinity with which it binds its 1st. This is called &#8220;cooperative binding&#8221;.  Naturally, if there&#8217;s cooperative binding there&#8217;s also cooperative release &#8211; once some oxygen is released, the rest is more prone to release. Hemoglobin&#8217;s lower affinity (compared to myoglobin) and cooperative binding are both critical to its biological function.</p>
<p>Hb can also transport H<sup>+</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Only in the T state, it can bind H+ to D94 &amp; H146, and CO<sub>2</sub> can bind to the N-terminal group of each globin chain. These interactions stabilize the T state, and so the binding of H<sup>+</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub> is inversely proportional to O<sub>2</sub>. High CO<sub>2</sub> increases H<sup>+</sup> due to equilibrium with dissociated carbonic acid; therefore in tissues with high CO<sub>2</sub> and low pH, Hb loses affinity for oxygen and releases it (perfect since those are the tissues that need oxygen). pH&#8217;s effect on Hb binding to oxygen is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_effect">Bohr effect</a>.</p>
<p>Effects of 2,3-Bisphopshogylcerate (BPG) on Hb. BPG is constitutively present in red blood cells but increases in response to altitude (low pO<sub>2</sub>). Without BPG, the T state is unstable and the R state is more favored, thus Hb&#8217;s affinity for oxygen would be higher. BPG is present in red blood cells at approximately the same concentration as Hb (1:1 stoichiometry?). 1 BPG molecule binds each Hb molecule in a pocket at the center of the tetramer &#8211; a pocket present only in the T state. In the presence of BPG, it takes <em>more</em> O<sub>2</sub> binding events to induce the T → R transition.</p>
<p>At sea level, Hb releases 38% of the maximum oxygen it can carry. At altitude it would release only 30% if it had the same affinity, because the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs is lower. However at altitude, BPG is upregulated, thus stabilizing the T state and reducing the affinity of Hb for oxygen. The reduction in affinity allows it to shed more oxygen by the time it reaches the pO<sub>2</sub> found in tissue, for a total of 37% of maximum &#8211; approximately the same amount as at sea level.</p>
<p><strong>misc</strong></p>
<p>Micelles.  According to Haynes, adding 1 molecule of fatty acid decreases entropy of water, while adding 100 increases entropy b/c of micelle.  This argument sounds inconsistent: the driving force for micelle formation has to be the *initially* lower entropy upon adding the 100 molecules.</p>
