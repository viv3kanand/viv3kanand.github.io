A year ago, President Obama announced the [Precision Medicine Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/precision-medicine) (PMI), a vision to transform medicine by delivering "the right treatment at the right time to the right person". Today, we attended a summit at the White House celebrating the one-year annniversary of the PMI, where it was our incredible honor to meet the President, and for Sonia to sit on a panel with the President where she discussed our personal mission to cure prion disease, and how it relates to the goals of precision medicine.

Here's a video of the event:

For now, I just wanted to share the news, and say thank you, Mr. President, for giving us this opportunity, and thank you to everyone who helped us get here. It's been an amazing four years for Sonia and me, and we have so much work ahead of us. But however long the road ahead, what we saw today was a public commitment to empowering patients, to transforming the culture of science, and to ushering in a new era of smarter drug discovery. And all of that fills us with optimism.
