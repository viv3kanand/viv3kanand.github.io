My name is **Vivekanand** and I am a full time researcher at [Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB)](https://www.igib.res.in/). More specifically, I do Bioinformatics (Transcriptomics, Genomics, Proteomics and some statistics). I'm not sure if I'm safe to say I am an expert in the field but I'm a constant learner. Sometimes when I wanted to check upon some of my old work for reference, I couldn't find it for some reason. May be, improper documentation of my work. Well, that was not the only reason I wanted to write a blog. There are several others.

It's not so long back I've decided to quit this field for good. It was not working out for me. After all that struggle, now I feel like I'm in the right place where I wanted to be. So that's one reason I wanted to write what I do. Just to motivate myself. A little self motivation would work, doesn't it?

I been referring to different blogs during my whole career. They were literally helpful. And whenever I end up finishing something new or strikes my mind, I used to make a copy of the code chunk in my [Github](https://github.com/viv3kanand) repository. But to be honest I had no idea how it worked then. I was just dumping my code there. Well then I have decided to organize it, but Meh! It never worked.

Not so long ago, me with one of my best buddies, [Naveen](https://github.com/naveenluke) organized a workshop and that's when it strike me, how important it is to have a blog. At least to help myself organizing my stuff. Nonetheless, if it helps someone else, I would be really glad (That's one passion I have). And I decided to have it in the github page itself. Well, they provide free hosting and I can easily manage the stuffs there now. It took me sometime to figure out though. There are several other free domains than github, yet I was adamant to have it with github it self. I don't know what fancied me to be honest. But I am happy that I'm here finally.

Yet, I suck bad at designing a theme for the blog by myself with Jekyll. And never liked the free themes came with it. I wanted something sober. Then I realized I could make use of the **pull** function in github for borrowing a theme. One of the blogs I frequent is [Eric Minikel](https://github.com/ericminikel)'s [cureffi](http://www.cureffi.org). I really admire his efforts to detour his journey as a researcher from a designer for a greater cause. His blog has also motivated me in writing this blog. I loved the design he had for his blog and I decided to use his template for mine.

After scratching over the **liquid** style coding **jekyll** has, I figured how to customize the features. So I thought, until I make a design on my own, I would use this as my template.

Finally, I am still not sure if I will be writing just Bioinformatics related blogs. I will most likely document things I learn everyday, something related to the kind of work I do, or the game I play and may be whatever comes to my mind randomly. I found a way to organize it so. I hope it works! ( :
