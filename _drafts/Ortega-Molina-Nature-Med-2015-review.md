# Paper Objective

* Define the function of KMT2D (MML2) in healthy and malignant B cells

# Materials and Methods

* Retrieved Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPCs) from VavP-BCL2 transgenic fetal liver cells. 
    + VavP promotor drives the expression of Bcl2 oncogene resulting in the development of B-cell lymphoma
* Transduced HPCs with murine stem cell virus (MSCV) retroviruses encoding a GFP reporter and either:
    + short hairpin RNAs targetting KMT2D (n = 30)
    + empty vector (n = 37)
    + Myc oncogene as positive control for lymphomagenesis (n = 16)

* 104 human FL specimens
* 347 DLBCL specimens

# Results

## Consequences of KMT2D mutations in human lymphomas

* Cohort of 104 human FL specimens
    + 40% of these samples had a mutation, but not apparent hotspots
    + MLL2 mutations were not associated with FL grade
* Cohort of 347 DLBCL specimens treated with R-CHOP
    + Nonsense mutation frequency was 17.6% in GCB and 8.4% in ABC 
    + Not linked to OS, PFS, DSS, or TTP
    + > The lack of correlation may indicate no effect of this specific treatment, or it may reflect alternate changes in tumors with wild-type KMT2D that equally affect outcomes

## KMT2D controls a common set of genes in mouse and human FLs

* 7 human FL specimens with KMT2D nonsense mutations vs. 12 with wild-type KMT2D (n = 19)
    + Differential expression revealed trend for down-regulation of gene expression in mutated KMT2D cases
* 5 mice KMT2D- knockdown (n = 5) and control lymphomas (n = 4)
    + Differential expression revealed trend for down-regulation of gene expression in knockdown KMT2D cases
* Between the human and mice cohort KMT2D mutated and knockdown cohorts respectively, enriched genes were common between both cohorts:

    > This suggests the downregulation of a conserved gene expression signature in human and mouse KMT2D-deficient lymphomas.

* Pathway analysis on these common genes revealed genes related to immune signaling and B cell differentation pathways.
