A nucleobase is a nitrogen-containing biological compound (nitrogenous bases). The primary nucleobases are 1) cytosine (DNA and RNA), 2) guanine (DNA and RNA), 3) adenine (DNA and RNA), 4) thymine (DNA), and 5) uracil (RNA). 
* When a nucleobase is combined with a 5-carbon sugar this forms a nucleoside.
* What a nucleoside is combined with a phosphate backbone, then this becomes a nucleotide.
