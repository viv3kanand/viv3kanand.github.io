Just came back from attending the 10th International Symposium of Hodgkin Lymphoma (ISHL10). It was my first time attending this conference which happens once every 3 years and I am fortunate enough to be able to experience it near the end of my PhD. After reading papers and following the work of so many giants in the field (e.g. Rulf Kuppers, Margarent Shipp, Steve Ansell), it truly was great to be able to meet them in person.

In this post, I wish to describe some of the major themes that were discussed at the ISHL10 conference. As a disclaimer, I am not an oncologist and so my understanding may be over simplified.

## ABVD vs. BEACOPP

The great first-line treatment reigmen debate of ABVD vs. BEACOPP. I have been hearing about this debate for a long time through papers, but at this conference I really learned of the gravity of the debate. It seems that BEACOPP is the primary first-treatment option in Germany while everywhere else in the world they use ABVD. It's well known that patients who receive BEACOPP have a higher overall survival rate than those who receive ABVD. However, this higher overall survival rate comes at a cost in that patients who experience a relapse have poor survival.

## Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma

There was a major session dedicated to pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (PHL) at ISHL10. Treatment of 

## HRS Sequencing

Hodgkin lymphoma is a unique disease compared to other types of lymphomas because of the paucity of the tumor Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in the tumor mass (~1%). As a result, the somatic genomic landscape of these tumor cells remains essentially elusive. During the "Biology and Microenvironment" session, two talks focused on the enrichment of HRS cells (via micro-dissection)...  So it seems that we are finally getting closer to being able to decode the somatc genome of HRS cells!

## PD-1 Blockade and Its Unknown Mechanism of Action in Hodgkin Lymphoma

As the hottest topic right now in the field of cancer therapy is immunotherapy, there was no shortage of immunotherapy talks. A recent article by Ansell et al. NEJM (2016) demonstrated how the use of PD-1 blockage (nivolumab) was highly effective on patients with relapsed HL. This is figure 1 from the paper:

Clearly demonstrating a reduction in tumor burden in over 23 patients after being treated with Nivolumab. This is great, but a talk delivered by Alison Moskowitz on "Mode of action of PD1 / PD-L1 MoAbs in HL" highlighted how it is unclear why PD-1 blockade even works in HL in the first place. Firstly, it has been shown that tumor HRS cells are characterized by alterations in MHC class I (Reichel et al. 2015) and II (Steidl, Shah et al. 2011) genes suggesting a disruption in antigen presentation and hence immune escape. So even if the "breaks" were turned off, the lack of antigen presentation means the immune system still wouldn't be able to find these tumor cells. When we also consider the fact that CD8+ T-cells are not prevalent in the tumour microenvironment of HL, it makes a bit of mystery why PD-1 blockade even works.
