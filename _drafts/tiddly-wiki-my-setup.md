Every once in a while, I encounter something in my life that makes me say "Wow,
this is the greatest thing since sliced bread." In 2017, that was TiddlyWiki. It
was exactly what I needed and wished I had known about many years ago (would 
have been invaluable to me during my undergraduate and graduate years).  Since 
then, I've been happily building my personal TiddlyWiki, customizing it, and 
sharing my experience with others. Quite a few times now, I've had the 
opportunity to sit down and demonstrate my setup and how I use TiddlyWiki. I 
figured it woud be good to get this information down in a blog post in hopes 
that it may be a resource for others out there.

What I hope to convey in this post is:

* How to install and get started with TiddlyWiki
* Tips/tricks that I have done to enhanced my experience with TiddlyWiki

I won't be going over a tutorial on how to use TiddlyWiki. I believe that it is
fairly straightforward to jump into and the main website already has some good
documentation on how to use it.

## What is TiddlyWiki? 

As described on its website as:

> a unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex 
> information.

In other words, it's a personal wiki that allows for you to capture and 
organize your notes in a flexible way. The fundamental unit of a TiddlyWiki is a 
"tiddler", which are meant to store sets of information that can be tagged
and linked together very easily. I suggest watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtCUr83XgyE) 
for a quick introduction on what TiddlyWiki is.

## Getting Setup with TiddlyWiki

Getting started with TiddlyWiki is fairly straightforward. There are two 
approaches to do this:

* Single HTML file approach
* Node.js approach (my preferred approach)

### Single HTML file approach

The single HTML approach is the quick and easy way to get started. Simple go to 
the [TiddlyWiki website](https://tiddlywiki.com) and download an empty copy of 
TiddlyWiki (`empty.html`). Then open this HTML file in your browser and you 
should be presented with a "Getting Started" screen:

<p align="middle">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tiddlywiki/tiddlywiki_empty.png" alt = "TiddlyWiki Empty HTML" />
</p>

From there, you can basically just start using TiddlyWiki. As I mentioned at the
beginning of this post, I won't go into any tutorial as to how to use it. I 
would recommend going to the TiddlyWiki website, which has a plethora of 
resources that can help you.

The important thing to recognize here is that **your entire TiddlyWiki is 
encapsulated inside a single HTML file**. As such, any changes you make will 
simply change this one file. This allows you to easily share your entire wiki to 
others. Additionally, you also deposit this HTML file to some cloud based 
storage (e.g. Google Drive) allowing you to sync aross machines. 

While this single HTML file approach is great for getting started, I've found
the **biggest disadvantage is that the HTML file can become monolithic and 
unwieldy over time as you add more content**. As a consequence, using a 
cloud-based storage solution may result in syncing issues because every single 
change you make triggers a sync of the HTML file. I have also been in situations 
where I would switch to another computer and forget to wait for the entire 
syncing process to finish (this could be long depending on how big your file 
is). I may end up editing an older version of the file creating further syncing 
issues. Although this may seem pedantic, this has occurred enough to be more 
than just a nuisance!

This is why I would advocate for the alternative approach of using TiddlyWiki
through Node.js

### Node.js approach

The Node.js approach requires only a few extra steps. First, you need to install 
Node.js. These instructions will depend on your operating system. On Mac OSX, 
you can use HomeBrew to install Node.js:

```bash
brew install node
```

Then use the node package manager, run:

```bash
sudo npm install -g tiddlywiki
```

If all goes well, you will have tiddlywiki installed. You can confirm this with:

```bash
# Check which version of TiddlyWiki is installed on your machine
tiddlywiki --version
```

```bash
5.1.19
```

Now create a wiki:

```bash
# Create a folder for a new wiki that includes server-related components
tiddlywiki test_wiki --init server
```

This creates subfolder in your current directory called `test_wiki`. Then you 
start the wiki:

```bash
# Start TiddlyWiki. This is served on port 8080 by default.
tiddlywiki test_wiki --server
```

You should then be able to go to your web browser, enter the URL 
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/`, and you should see the same start up screen as in the 
single HTML file approach. By default, the server will start on the port 8080. 
But you can change this by adding a different port number to the end of the 
command. For instance, to host on host 8888

```bash
tiddlywiki test_wiki --server 8888
```

This will the TiddlyWiki will be hosted on `http://127.0.0.1:8888`.

### So why is this better than the single HTML file approach?

The major advantage of using the Node.js approach is that your tiddlers are each
saved as an individual file. For instance, if I had a TiddlyWiki that had 4 
tiddlers, you can see how the folder structure of your Wiki is:

```
test_wiki/
├── tiddlers
│   ├── $__StoryList.tid
│   ├── Another\ tiddler!.tid
│   ├── I\ am\ a\ tiddler\ also.tid
│   ├── Test\ tiddler.tid
│   └── Tiddler\ for\ the\ win.tid
└── tiddlywiki.info

1 directory, 6 files
```

Each tiddler is stored under the `tiddlers` folder and with the suffix `.tid`.
This means that each change to a tiddler, only affects that one tiddler and not
the others. 

## Enhancing your TiddlyWiki

What follows is a bunch of enhancements that I have made to my TiddlyWiki that
have greatly improved my experience with it.

### Adding a table of contents

You can add a table of contents (ToC) to your sidebar by doing the following:

1. Create a tiddler called "TableOfContents"
1. Tag the tiddler with `$:/tags/SideBar`
1. Then set the contents of the tiddler to: 

    ```
    <div class="tc-table-of-contents">

    <<toc-selective-expandable 'TableOfContents'>>

    </div>
    ```
1. Add a caption field with the text "Contents" (or whatever you want the ToC to
     appear as in the Sidebar.
1. Add a list-after field with the text `$:/core/ui/SideBar/Open`. This controls
     where the ToC appears in the SideBar. In this case, the ToC will appear 
     right after the Open.

After this, you can add entries to your ToC by simplying tagging the tiddler 
with the tag `TableOfContents`. If you tag your tiddlers with the titles of 
other tiddlers that are already in the ToC, then these tiddlers will appear
nested in the ToC. For instance:

<p align="middle">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tiddlywiki/tiddlywiki_toc.png" alt = "TiddlyWiki ToC" />
</p>

Notice how Sub-tiddler1 appears nested under Tiddler1.

See the [official instructions on the TiddlyWiki website for more details](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Adding%20a%20table%20of%20contents%20to%20the%20sidebar:%5B%5BAdding%20a%20table%20of%20contents%20to%20the%20sidebar%5D%5D%20TableOfContents%20HelloThere%20GettingStarted%20Community).

#### Controlling the order of your ToC elements

# Adding a new category to the sidebar

# How to add images

# Plugins

## Syntax highlighting

## CodeMirror

* Vim plugin. Disable of esc key.

# Table of contents 

TiddlyWiki contains several [macros](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Macros:Macros%20HelloThere%20GettingStarted%20Community). 
that can be used for generating a tree of tiddler links by analysing tags. The 
one I like the most is [toc-tabbed-external-nav](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Example%20Table%20of%20Contents%3A%20Tabbed%20External).

A minor gripe that I had with this is that there is no easy way to modify the 
tiddlers without having to directly open and edit it. I found this [gem](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Example%20Table%20of%20Contents%3A%20Tabbed%20External)
that contains a modified version of this macro to add an open and edit button.

What you have to do this is create a tiddler and then add these contents:

```
\define tocTools( to )
@@.tocTools
<$button to="$to$">{{$:/core/images/link}}</$button>
<$button to="$to$" message="tm-edit-tiddler">{{$:/core/images/edit-button}}</$button>
@@
\end

\define smokeMirrors( selected )
<$macrocall $name="tocTools" to={{$selected$}}/>
\end

\define toc-tabbed-internal-nav-gu( tag, sort:"", selectedTiddler:"$:/temp/toc/selectedTiddler", unselectedText, missingText, template:"" )
<$tiddler tiddler={{$selectedTiddler$}}>
  <div class="tc-tabbed-table-of-contents">
    <$linkcatcher to="$selectedTiddler$">
      <div class="tc-table-of-contents">
        <$macrocall $name="toc-selective-expandable" tag="""$tag$""" sort="""$sort$""" itemClassFilter=<<toc-tabbed-selected-item-filter selectedTiddler:"""$selectedTiddler$""">>/>
      </div>
    </$linkcatcher>
    <div class="tc-tabbed-table-of-contents-content">
      <<smokeMirrors $selectedTiddler$>>
      <$linkcatcher to="$selectedTiddler$">
        <$reveal state="""$selectedTiddler$""" type="nomatch" text="">
          <$transclude mode="block" tiddler="$template$">
            <h1><<toc-caption>></h1>
            <$transclude mode="block">$missingText$</$transclude>
          </$transclude>
        </$reveal>
        <$reveal state="""$selectedTiddler$""" type="match" text="">
          $unselectedText$
        </$reveal>
      </$linkcatcher>
    </div>
  </div>
</$tiddler>
```

What you are doing is defining a new macro called `toc-tabbed-internal-nav-gu`.
Tag this tiddler with the tag `$:/tags/Macro`. This makes the macro available to 
all tiddlers (if you don't do this, then the macro is only available in the 
tiddler that defined it). Now in the tiddler that you want to use the macro in, 
you call the macro as follows:

```
<<toc-tabbed-external-nav-gu "TableOfContents">>
```

Now you get two extra buttons at the top of each tab that allows you to easily
open and edit the tiddler in your river.
