title:  "What is with all the -Genesis?"
tags: [cancer]

As I have been in PhD thesis writing mode, I have been reading a lot of papers and have come across all sorts of "-genesis" terms (e.g. patho-genesis, tumouri-genesis, onco-genesis). While these terms appear to be used interchangeably, each term does have subtle differences that substantiates the appropriate context they should be used in. In this post, I will define and discuss the differences in the the following "-genesis" terms:

1. Pathogenesis
1. Oncogenesis
1. Tumourigenesis
1. Carcinogenesis

## Pathogenesis


* Pathogenesis refers to the process that leads to the development of a disease
* Oncogenesis refers to the process that leads to the development of a cancer.
* Tumourigenesis is similar to oncogenesis, but should only be applied in the context of solid or pseudo-solid cancers (e.g. lymphomas) depending on how specific one wants to get. The reason being is that these types of cancers form tumour masses while liquid cancers (e.g. leukemias) do not technically have a "tumour". So one can think of oncogenesis as covering both the solid and liqud cancer development.
* Carcinogenesis refers to the process of DNA damage by carcinogens that leads to the development of cancer. This would be most applicable to skin cancers.
