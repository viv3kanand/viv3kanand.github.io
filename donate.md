Research doesn't happen without money! Your tax-deductible donation will go to [Prion Alliance](http://www.prionalliance.org/), the 501(c)(3) non-profit that Sonia and I run to fund research towards a cure for prion disease. All funds go to science.

Three things to know about donating:

1. You are awesome.
2. We accept donations via PayPal or check.
3. For tax deduction purposes, Prion Alliance's EIN is 46-0732060.
