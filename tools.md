This is a collection of some quick little tools I built for research and blogging.

+ [Harvard libproxy bookmarklet](/tools/harvard-libproxy-bookmarklet) - a button you can put in your bookmarks bar for 1-click access to the full text of closed-access journal articles via Harvard's proxy server.
+ [PubMed markdown citations](/tools/pubmed-markdown-citations) - a two-button system for converting PubMed links to reference-style links for blog posts written in markdown.
