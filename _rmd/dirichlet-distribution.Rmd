## What is te Dirichlet Distribution?

* Dirichlet distribution is a probability distribution on probability distributions. In other words, it is a distribution over distributions. In fact, the beta distribution is a special case of the dirichlet for 2 dimensions.
* A variable, $\theta$, that is dirichlet distributed is represented as $\theta \sim Dir(\alpha)$

## Probability Density Function
	
$$p(\theta) = \frac{1}{\beta(\alpha)}\prod_{i=1}^{n}\theta_{i}^{\alpha_{i-1}}I(\theta \in S)$$

* $\beta$: Beta function
* $\theta = (\theta_{1}, ..., \theta_{n})$. Set of n-dimensional vectors.
* $\alpha = (\alpha_{1}, ..., \alpha_{n}), \alpha_{i} > 0$.
