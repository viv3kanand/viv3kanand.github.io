delay	numeric	"treatment_days_to_endpoint/control_days_to_endpoint - 1. you could calculate this yourself, but some authors just directly give a percent delay, without stating times for treated or control groups.  those are included in this field as well."
reported_p	numeric	"p value for treated group vs. control group time to endpoint, as reported by author, regardless of statistical test used.  1 when author simply states 'not significant', blank when author does not provide a p value"
eyeballed	integer	"1 = one or more items of data in this row was eyeballed from a figure or estimated from discussion in text, because the author never provided a number. 0 = all numbers are as provided by author.  one borderline exception to this is that where authors give a range (e.g. ""n=10 to 12 mice per group""), i take the midpoint (in this case, 11) and still leave 0 in this field."
